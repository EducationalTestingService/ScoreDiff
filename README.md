# Introduction
The file ScoreDiff.R includes R code for performing score differencing, which is essentially an examination of whether the performance difference of an examinee on two sets of items is statistically significant. Score differencing can be used to detect several types of test fraud including item preknowledge and fradulent erasures. More details about score differencing, its use, and its applications can be found in an ETS Research Memorandum (Sinharay, 2019). The files "ScoresDich", "ScoresPoly", and "ItemInfDich.csv" include data files that are used in examples of applications of ScoreDiff.R described in the ETS Research Memorandum.
